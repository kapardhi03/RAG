            "[Document(page_content='On 7 October 2023, an armed conflict broke out between Israel and Hamas-led Palestinian militants from the Gaza Strip after the latter launched a multi-pronged invasion of southern Israel. After clearing Hamas militants, the Israeli military retaliated by conducting an extensive aerial bombardment campaign on Gazan targets, followed by a large-scale ground invasion of Gaza. More than 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians, and more than 11,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed in the fighting. UN General Secretary António Guterres stated that Gaza is \"becoming a graveyard for children\". The current hostilities constitute the fifth war of the Gaza–Israel conflict, which is part of the broader Israeli–Palestinian conflict.In the morning of 7 October, Palestinian militant groups launched a barrage of rockets against Israel, while around 3,000 militants breached the Gaza–Israel barrier and attacked Israeli military bases and civilian population centres, as well as a music festival near Re\\'im. Between the attack and Israel\\'s counterattack, more than 200 Israeli soldiers and more than 800 civilians were killed, alongside an estimated 1,000 militants. Over 200 Israeli civilians and soldiers, as well as some foreign nationals, were also taken captive to the Gaza Strip. Hamas said its attack was in response to the blockade of the Gaza Strip, the expansion of illegal Israeli settlements, rising Israeli settler violence, and recent escalations at Al-Aqsa.Israel\\'s declaration of a state of war the following day marked the start of the most significant military escalation in the region since the Yom Kippur War in 1973; its lengthy aerial bombardment of Gaza dropped 6,000 bombs in the first six days of the conflict. The airstrikes were coordinated with a total blockade of the Gaza strip in addition to cutting off water, fuel, food and electricity. Israel urged 1.1 million Gazans to evacuate northern Gaza, while Hamas called on residents to stay in their homes. On 27 October, Israel launched a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip, which remains ongoing.\\nWidespread civilian deaths have led to both Israel and Hamas being accused of war crimes. The United Nations reported that around 1.5 million Palestinians, over 70% of Gaza\\'s population, as well as over 200,000 Israelis have been internally displaced. There are acute shortages of drinking water, food and fuel in Gaza. The health system is failing; most hospitals are out of service, and doctors are performing C-sections and amputations without anesthetic. The war has led to widespread global protests that have focused on a variety of issues including demands for a ceasefire, and the release of hostages. The United States vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire; a week later, a non-binding advisory resolution passed overwhelmingly in the United Nations General Assembly. Israel has rejected ceasefire calls, asserting it will not stop until all hostages taken by Hamas are returned.\\nHamas announced that it is ready to release all Israeli hostages in exchange for the release of all Palestinian prisoners.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\n\\nThe Gaza Strip and Israel have been in conflict since the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza in 2005, which it had hitherto occupied since 1967. The United Nations and several human rights organizations continue to classify Gaza as held under Israeli occupation, due to its effective military control over the territory. Hamas\\'s victory in the 2006 Palestinian legislative election and the subsequent battle between it and Fatah, which Hamas ultimately won, significantly escalated tensions with Israel. Israel, due to severe security concerns imposed a blockade that significantly damaged Gaza\\'s economy. International rights groups have decried the blockade as a form of collective punishment, while Israel defended it as necessary to prevent weapons and dual-use goods from entering the territory.Since the blockade, Is', metadata={'title': '2023 Israel–Hamas war', 'summary': 'On 7 October 2023, an armed conflict broke out between Israel and Hamas-led Palestinian militants from the Gaza Strip after the latter launched a multi-pronged invasion of southern Israel.

The current hostilities constitute the fifth war of the Gaza–Israel conflict, which is part of the broader Israeli–Palestinian conflict.In the morning of 7 October, Palestinian militant groups launched a barrage of rockets against Israel, while around 3,000 militants breached the Gaza–Israel barrier and attacked Israeli military bases and civilian population centres, as well as a music festival near Re\\'im. Between the attack and Israel\\'s counterattack, more than 200 Israeli soldiers and more than 800 civilians were killed, alongside an estimated 1,000 militants. Over 200 Israeli civilians and soldiers, as well as some foreign nationals, were also taken captive to the Gaza Strip. Hamas said its attack was in response to the blockade of the Gaza Strip, the expansion of illegal Israeli settlements, rising Israeli settler violence, and recent escalations at Al-Aqsa.Israel\\'s declaration of a state of war the following day marked the start of the most significant military escalation in the region since the Yom Kippur War in 1973; its lengthy aerial bombardment of Gaza dropped 6,000 bombs in the first six days of the conflict. The airstrikes were coordinated with a total blockade of the Gaza strip in addition to cutting off water, fuel, food and electricity. Israel urged 1.1 million Gazans to evacuate northern Gaza, while Hamas called on residents to stay in their homes. On 27 October, Israel launched a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip, which remains ongoing.\\nWidespread civilian deaths have led to both Israel and Hamas being accused of war crimes. The United Nations reported that around 1.5 million Palestinians, over 70% of Gaza\\'s population, as well as over 200,000 Israelis have been internally displaced. There are acute shortages of drinking water, food and fuel in Gaza. The health system is failing; most hospitals are out of service, and doctors are performing C-sections and amputations without anesthetic. The war has led to widespread global protests that have focused on a variety of issues including demands for a ceasefire, and the release of hostages. The United States vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire; a week later, a non-binding advisory resolution passed overwhelmingly in the United Nations General Assembly. Israel has rejected ceasefire calls, asserting it will not stop until all hostages taken by Hamas are returned.\\nHamas announced that it is ready to release all Israeli hostages in exchange for the release of all Palestinian prisoners.', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Israel%E2%80%93Hamas_war'}), Document(page_content='On 7 October 2023, as part of the surprise attack on Israel at the beginning of the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, Hamas militants abducted around 200 people to the Gaza Strip, and estimated that another 50 had been kidnapped by other Palestinian militant factions. Hamas\\'s demands included a prisoner exchange, fuel and other supplies, the opening of the Rafah Border Crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip, and a suspension of Israeli airstrikes and shelling. Several countries have been involved in negotiations, with Qatar taking the lead. Hamas has offered releasing all hostages in exchange for Israel releasing all Palestinian prisoners, a position supported by some Israeli families.The precise ratio of soldiers and civilians among the captives is unknown. In addition to Israeli citizens, almost half of the hostages include dual citizens and foreign nationals. About 30 children have been kidnapped. The captives are likely being held in different locations in the Gaza Strip.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\n\\nThe issue of hostages and prisoners is considered emotional for both Israelis and Palestinians. As of November 2023, there are over 10,000 Palestinians (including at least 170 children) in Israeli jails and prisons. Some have been convicted of terrorism by Israeli authorities. 1,200 Palestinians are held without any charges or trial; Israel justifies the practice citing security reasons.Israel has engaged in prisoner exchanges with armed groups on several occasions. In 2006, Hamas captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. Israel secured his release in 2011, in exchange for the release of 1,000 Palestinians from Israeli custody, including some it had convicted of terrorism.On 31 August 2023, Israel warned its citizens that Hamas was trying to kidnap them.At the time of its attack, Hamas was already holding two Israelis hostage: Ethiopian Israeli Avera Mengistu (since 2014) and Bedouin Israeli Hisham al-Sayed (since 2015). Hamas has also sought to ransom the remains of Israeli soldiers Oron Shaul and Hadar Goldin, which they seized during the 2014 Gaza War.\\n\\n\\n== Events of October 7 ==\\n\\nOn the morning of 7 October 2023, around 6:30 a.m. IST, Hamas launched an attack into Israel from multiple sites on its border with the Gaza Strip. The attack included ground and motorized infiltration into Israeli territory, attacks on Israel Defense Forces bases and exchanges of fire with security forces, massacres and shooting of Israeli civilians, and takeovers of settlements and military facilities. The ground incursion was combined with and backed by a sustained barrage of thousands of rockets.At around 7:00 am, Hamas militants raided many settlements and kibbutzim (intentional communities) in the Gaza periphery area of Israel. They carried out massacres in more than 10 kibbutzim, as well as a massacre at a music festival near Re\\'im resulting in at least 260 deaths. The Economist described the combined attacks as \"the biggest terror attack in [Israel\\'s] history\".As part of Israel\\'s counteroffensive, Israel implemented a \"total blockade\" of the Gaza strip until the hostages have been released. Amnesty International describes this measure as having been \"taken to punish civilians in Gaza for the actions of Palestinian armed groups,\" amounting to collective punishment.In the initial wave of attacks, militants kidnapped civilians and brought them back to Gaza as captives. According to statements by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, around 200 soldiers and civilians were captured or abducted during the raid on the Gaza periphery settlements. Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, an IDF spokesperson, reported on 7 October that military officers were among those captured. Israel confirmed the identity of 203 captives, among them 30 children, while Gaza spokespeople reported holding roughly 200, estimating that another 50 were held by other factions. The IDF says it captured \"handbooks\" made by Hamas to instruct its militants; these handbooks instructed to \"kill the difficult', metadata={'title': '2023 Israel–Hamas war hostage crisis', 'summary': \"On 7 October 2023, as part of the surprise attack on Israel at the beginning of the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, Hamas militants abducted around 200 people to the Gaza Strip, and estimated that another 50 had been kidnapped by other Palestinian militant factions.

Hamas meticulously planned for a massacre of Israeli civilians with the goal of provoking Israel to invade Gaza.  The attacks initiated the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, almost exactly fifty years after the Yom Kippur War began on 6 October 1973. Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups named the attacks Operation Al-Aqsa Flood (or Deluge; Arabic: عملية طوفان الأقصى, romanized: ʿamaliyyat ṭūfān al-ʾAqṣā), while they are referred to in Israel as Black Saturday (Hebrew: השבת השחורה), the Simchat Torah Massacre (הטבח בשמחת תורה), and the 7/10 attacks or 7 October attacks (פיגועי 7 באוקטובר).The attacks began in the early morning with a rocket barrage of at least 3,000 rockets launched against Israel and vehicle-transported and powered paraglider incursions into its territory. Hamas fighters breached the Gaza–Israel barrier, killing civilians in neighboring Israeli communities and attacking Israeli military bases. In a single day, around 845 Israeli civilians and a minimum of 345 Israeli soldiers and policemen were killed in nearby towns, kibbutzim, military bases and at a music festival near Re\\'im. Around 200 Israeli civilians and soldiers were taken as hostages to the Gaza Strip, of which the number of kidnapped children is about 30.At least 44 nations, mostly Western, denounced the attack as terrorism, while Arab and Muslim countries including Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Syria, Iran and Iraq have blamed Israel for the attack. The day is considered the bloodiest in Israel\\'s history and the deadliest for Jews since The Holocaust.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\n\\nThis attack was the first major engagement between Hamas and Israelis since the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis, although there have been smaller conflicts. An anonymous source \"close to Hamas\" claimed that Hamas reduced military activity in a deliberate effort to deceive Israel into believing Hamas was not a threat. In order to maintain stability in the region, the Israeli Defense Ministry decided in 2022 to issue an additional 1,500 permits for Gazans to work in Israel, bringing the total number of workers to 17,000. Mohammed Deif, commander of the attack, named the operation \"Al-Aqsa Flood\" in reference to the 2022 Al-Aqsa clashes, in which Israeli police raided a mosque following clashes between Palestinians and police.Hamas militants had prepared in at least six training camps across the Gaza Strip for two years before the attack. This involved conducting practice hostage takings, storming of mock Israeli settlements, and training with motorized paragliders. Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus stated that such training facilities were \"nothing new\" and that Israel had \"struck many training areas over the years in the different rounds of escalation\". Documents later found on killed Hamas militants, and obtained by the Washington Post and NBC News, revealed extensive study of communities and army bases near the Gaza-Israel border, and the intent to inflict as many civilian casualties and capture as many hostages as possible. Hamas had meticulously planned to commit a massacre of Israeli civilians of such proportions, that Israel would be forced to react with a massive invasion of Gaza. This was preceded by years of deception, signalling to the Israelis that Hamas was no longer interested in a military conflict.According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, in the weeks before the attack, 500 members of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad attended combat training in Iran led by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and attended by its Quds Force commander Esmail Qaani. The Journal also reported that at a meeting in Beirut on 2 October, five days before the attack, Iranian security officials \"gave the green light\" for the attac', metadata={'title': '2023 Hamas attack on Israel', 'summary': \"A series of coordinated attacks, conducted by the Palestinian Islamist militant group Hamas, from the Gaza Strip onto bordering areas in Israel, commenced on Saturday, 7 October 2023, a Sabbath day and date of several Jewish holidays.

The Israeli, American, EU, UK, Japanese, and Canadian governments define Hamas as a terrorist group. However some disagree with this characterization and claim Hamas are not terrorists. While the term \"international law\" pertains to states, it also applies to insurgent and terrorist armed forces. Even if an insurgency is deemed lawful — meaning it meets the criteria of \"just cause\", it must adhere to the principles of \"just means.\" Regarding Hamas and its combatants, even if they have a presumptive right to fight against what they term as an \"Israeli occupation,\" they must still abide by legal rules of \"discrimination,\" \"proportionality,\" and \"military necessity.\"On 9 October, 2023 Human Rights Watch stated that Hamas\\'s apparent targeting of civilians, indiscriminate attacks, and taking of hostages amounted to war crimes.On 10 October, 2023 the OHCHR stated the taking of hostages and use of human shields were war crimes. United Nations Human Rights chief Volker Türk noted that militant groups\\' \"horrifying mass killings\" were violations of international law.\\n\\n\\n=== Massacres ===\\n\\nOn 12 October, Jens David Ohlin argued Hamas\\'s attacks potentially violated Articles 6-8 of the Rome Statute. Ohlin asserted the attacks might violate Article 6, if it could be proved the perpetrators had \"genocidal intent.\" On 7 October, as his forces were massacring civilians, Ismail Haniyeh, the head of the Hamas Political Bureau, stated in a speech the intent of Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, saying, \"We want to liberate our land, our holy sites, our Al-Aqsa mosque, our prisoners.\" He concluded with the statement \"To [the enemy], we have only one thing to say to you: get out of our land. Get out of our sight. Get out of our city of Al-Quds [Jerusalem] and our al-Aqsa mosque. We no longer wish to see you on this land. This land is ours, Al-Quds is ours, everything [here] is ours. You are strangers in this pure and blessed land. There is no place of safety for you.\"According to Ohlin, militant groups violated Article 7 if there was evidence the attacks had been part of an organized \"plan or policy.\" Finally, Ohlin argued, the militant groups violated Article 8 by killing civilians. On 7 October, the militant groups massacred civilians. 260 were killed at the Re\\'im music festival, 112 at Be\\'eri, and 73 at Kfar Aza. Victims were reportedly subject to immolation, dismemberment, and beheading. On 15 October, a group of 100 Israeli and international law experts argued videos released on social media showed war crimes.At the Re\\'im music festival massacre, Hamas militants massacred 270 civilians and injured many more, methodically shooting fleeing and hiding attendees, as well as taking hostages, in the largest terror attack against concerts in history.

Dozens more were killed or executed in the following years as part of the conflict.\\n\\n\\n== Overview ==\\nHamas was founded in 1987, soon after the First Intifada broke out, as an offshoot of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. It is a Palestinian Sunni-Islamist fundamentalist organization, which is regarded, either in whole or in part, as a terrorist organization by several countries and international organizations, most notably by Israel, the United States and the European Union.Tensions between Fatah and Hamas began to rise in 2005 after the death of Yasser Arafat in November 2004. After the legislative election on 25 January 2006, which resulted in a Hamas victory, relations were marked by sporadic factional fighting. This became more intense after the two parties repeatedly failed to reach a deal to share government power, escalating in June 2007 and resulting in Hamas\\' takeover of Gaza. A major issue was control over the border crossings, especially the Rafah Border Crossing.\\nHamas leader Ismail Haniya formed a new PA government on 29 March 2006 comprising mostly Hamas members. Fatah and other factions had refused to join, especially as Hamas refused to accept the Quartet\\'s conditions, such as recognition of Israel and earlier agreements. As a result, a substantial part of the international community, especially Israel, the United States and European Union countries, refused to deal with the Hamas government and imposed sanctions. Following the abduction by Hamas militants of Gilad Shalit on 25 June 2006 in a cross-border raid via a tunnel out of Gaza, Israel detained nearly a quarter of PLC members and ministers on the West Bank during August 2006, intensified the boycott of Gaza and took other punitive measures.Calls for the implementation of the Cairo Declaration, including the formation of a unity government and the cessation of violence between Fatah and Hamas, were made in the Fatah–Hamas Mecca Agreement of 8 February 2007. The Hamas government was replaced on 17 March 2007 by a national unity government headed by Haniya comprising Hamas and Fatah ministers. In June 2007, Hamas fighters took control of the Gaza Strip and removed all Fatah officials. President Abbas, on 14 June, declared a state of emergency, dismissed Haniyeh\\'s national unity government and appointed an emergency government, and suspended articles of the Basic Law to circumvent the needed PNC approval.Hamas has been the de facto governing authority of the Gaza Strip since its takeover in June 2007. Since then, it has fought several wars with Israel, and the Palestinian Authority has been split into two polities, each seeing itself as the true representative of the Palestinian people – the Fatah-ruled Palestinian National Authority and the Hamas Government in Gaza.\\n\\n\\n== Preceding events ==\\n\\n\\n=== Involvement of Britain ===\\nDocuments published in the Palestine Papers reveal that in 2004 the British intelligence MI6 helped draw up a security plan for a Fatah-led Palestinian Authority. The plan mentioned as an objective, \"encourage and enable the Palestinian Authority (PA) to fully meet its security obligations under Phase 1 of the Roadmap\". It proposed a number of ways of \"degrading the capabilities of rejectionists\", naming Hamas, PIJ (Palestinian Islamic Jihad) and the al-Aqsa Brigades.

Aloni was subsequently seen on 8 October attending a meeting of top Israeli military officials.Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting published images of the capture of commanders of Nagorno-Karabakh by the Azerbaijani army in September 2023 as the capture of Israeli commanders by Hamas.A video of a CNN broadcast from near the Israel-Gaza border with audio added to suggest the network had faked an attack went viral on social media.Social media accounts based in India have spread pro-Israeli disinformation, with influencers misrepresenting videos purported to show school girls taken as sex slaves, or Hamas kidnapping a Jewish baby. Fact-checker Pratik Sinha said the \"Indian right-wing has made India the disinformation capital of the world\". The trend forms part of a wider pattern of fake news in India with an Islamophobic slant, including disinformation on Palestinians coming from the BJP IT Cell, a vehicle of India\\'s governing party, the BJP.An Israeli boy and his sisters killed during Hamas\\'s attack on Kibbutz Nir Oz on 7 October have been falsely accused of being \"crisis actors\".A photo shared by Israel showing the charred corpse of a baby was claimed by many on social media to have been AI-generated, based on AI detector \"AI or Not\". The claim was repeated by Al Jazeera Arabic. The company behind \"AI or Not\" later said that the result was a false positive caused by the image\\'s compression and blurred name tag; several experts who looked at the photo found it to be genuine. Other social media users claimed, based on a 4chan post, that the image had been altered from a similar photo of a dog, though researcher Tina Nikoukhah found that the dog picture was likely \"falsified using generative methods\".In a speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition on 28 October, Eli Beer, founder of an Israeli EMS organization, claimed that Hamas had burned a baby alive in an oven. The claim was repeated by journalist Dovid Efune, John Podhoretz and others, in tweets seen over 10 million times. Israeli journalists found no evidence for the claim, and a representative of ZAKA, a first responder organization, said the claim was \"false\". French newspaper Libération said the claim was likely \"entirely fictitious\".\\n\\n\\n=== On Gaza ===\\nViral claims that the IDF had destroyed Gaza\\'s Church of Saint Porphyrius on 9 October were debunked by the church. However, Israel attacked the church on 19 October killing 18 civilians.Disinformation experts uncovered an account on X that published false reports about Qatar threatening to cut off its gas exports if Israel continued to bombard the Gaza Strip.Following the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital explosion, an X account claiming to be an Al Jazeera journalist said they had video of a \"Hamas missile landing in the hospital\". Al Jazeera subsequently clarified that they were not associated with the account, and it was later removed. Another X account that promoted pro-Kremlin misinformation claimed The Wall Street Journal had reported that the explosion was caused by a Mark 84 bomb; The Wall Street Journal had not published such a report.A video showing a Palestinian child killed during an October 11 Israeli', metadata={'title': 'Disinformation in the 2023 Israel–Hamas war', 'summary': 'Disinformation has been wide-ranging, with the dissemination of false, misleading or unsubstantiated information on both sides in the conflict.

They employed missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), some of which were subsequently intercepted by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) over the Red Sea using the Arrow missile defense system; others fell short of their targets or were intercepted by the United States Navy and the Israeli Air Force.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\nThe Houthi movement is a Shiite militant organization that controls northern Yemen and is supported and funded by Iran, and reportedly serves as their proxy in regional wars. The movement\\'s slogan is \"Death to America, Death to Israel, Curse the Jews, Victory to Islam.\"After the outbreak of the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, militant groups across the Middle East, including the Houthis, expressed support for the Palestinians and threatened to attack Israel. Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi warned the United States against intervening, threatening retaliation with drones and missiles.\\n\\n\\n=== Types of weapons used by the Houthis ===\\nHouthi weapons come mainly from Iran. They are known to use surface-to-surface missiles, artillery rockets and UAVs. They have several missiles and UAVs capable of reaching Israel from Yemen:\\n\\nToufan - a Surface-to-surface missile, with a range of 1,800 km.\\nCruise missiles - from the Iranian Soumar family, with strike ranges of about 2,000 km.\\nQuds-2 missile - supposedly with a range of 1,350 km but made to strike Israel.\\n3-Samad and 4-Samad - attack UAVs with ranges of 1,800+ km.\\nWa’id drones - similar to Iran’s Shahed 136, attack UAV with a range of 2,500 km.\\n\\n\\n== Events ==\\n\\nFrom 19 October to 9 November 2023, the Houthis carried out six attacks aimed towards Israel.\\nOn 19 October 2023, the U.S. Navy warship USS Carney shot down three land-attack cruise missiles and several drones heading toward Israel launched by the Houthis in Yemen. This was the first action by the U.S. military to defend Israel since the outbreak of the war. It was later reported that the ship shot down four cruise missiles and 15 drones. Another missile was reportedly intercepted by Saudi Arabia.On 27 October 2023, two drones were fired in a northerly direction from the southern Red Sea. According to IDF officials, their target was Israel, but they did not cross the border from Egypt. Of the two drones, one fell short and hit a building adjacent to a hospital in Taba, Egypt, injuring six; the other was shot down near an electricity plant close to the town of Nuweiba, Egypt. A Houthi official later made a one-word post on Twitter after the drone crashed in Taba, mentioning the nearby Israeli town of \"Eilat\".On 31 October, an alert was triggered in Eilat, Eilot and the Shahorit industrial park area regarding the penetration of hostile aircraft from the Red Sea. The aircraft was successfully intercepted over the Red Sea. The Arrow system intercepted a ballistic missile and the Air Force intercepted several cruise missiles fired from the Red Sea towards Eilat. The Houthis took responsibility for the launches. One cruise missile was shot down by an F-35i Adir jet. The downing of the missile by the Arrow marks the first time it has been used in the Israel–Hamas war.On 1 November 1 at 0:45, the IDF intercepted an air threat fired from Yemen and identified south of Eilat.A U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone was shot down off the coast of Yemen by Houthi air defences on 8 November; the Pentagon previously claimed MQ-9 drones were flying over Gaza in an intelligence gathering role in order to aid in the hostage recovery efforts.On 9 November, the Houthis fired a missile towards the city of Eilat. The missile was intercepted by an \"Arrow 3\" missile, marking the first time it was used in an interception.On 14 November, the Houthis fired numerous missiles, one of which was aimed towards the city of Eilat.

Notable people with the surname include Aron Nijjar (English cricketer), Rob Nijjar (Canadian politician), Sunny Singh Nijjar (Indian actor), Surinder Singh Nijjar (Indian judge), and Hardeep Singh Nijjar (Canadian Sikh separatist leader). Hardeep Singh Nijjar was involved with the Khalistan movement and was shot and killed in 2023. He was accused by the Indian government of being a criminal and terrorist affiliated with the Khalistan Tiger Force. Canada expelled an Indian diplomat in connection with his assassination. India denied involvement and expelled a top Canadian diplomat in retaliation. Nijjar's involvement with the Khalistan Tiger Force included training and financing militants for the organization. He was also associated with Sikhs for Justice and spearheaded the group's Khalistan Referendum 2020 campaign. The Khalistan Tiger Force is a militant outfit of the Khalistan movement and was banned by the Indian government in 2023. It aims to revive terrorism in Punjab and challenges the territorial integrity, unity, national security, and sovereignty of India. It has been involved in targeted killings and claimed responsibility for the deaths of Indian Army soldiers. The Khalistan Tiger Force is allegedly backed by Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence.
